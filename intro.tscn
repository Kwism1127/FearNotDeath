The awe when those distant voices told you to kindly keep your opinions to yourself. The rapture when you began to truly understand the scope of the moment, and how radio would change the world forever. And finally, as distant others began to retire and the conversation died, the dread of rising static. The whispers from beyond that defy understanding yet conceal the secrets of reality within."
